# Haskell: the Craft of Functional Programming

This is the site for the third edition of the Haskell text, *Haskell: the Craft of Functional Programming*,  which is now freely available as a [PDF download](craft3e.pdf). The aim is to revise it, and make it available in a more interactive online version by the end of 2026. The errata and other materials are on the [legacy site](https://www.haskellcraft.com/), and will be incorporated into the new edition.
